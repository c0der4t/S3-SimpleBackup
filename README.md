#  S3-SimpleBackup
### ‚§¥ A simple S3 storage backup app

## Warning, this app is still under development
Although the application can now fully sync files up to an S3 bucket, it is important to understand that the app is still in development and being tested.

## üõë Security Warning
The app currently does not encrypt API keys at rest in the s3.ini file. Please opt for typing your keys into the UI manually each time you run the app. 
WE ARE WORKING ON A SECURE WAY TO STORE YOUR KEYS

Known Bugs:

- API keys are not encrypted at rest. Please type into interface each time for safety and avoid using s3.ini
